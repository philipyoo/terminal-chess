# Terminal Chess

A 2-Player Chess game played in the terminal.


## Goals

- Build a working chess game using Ruby.
- This is for my own personal growth and practice. Apply OOP, inheritance, and some creativity.
- Keep it DRY, efficient, and functional.
- Keep refactoring this as I become a better programmer :)


## Setup

In the terminal:
1. `git clone https://github.com/philipyoo/terminal-chess.git`
2. `cd terminal-chess`
3. `gem install colorize`
4. `cd lib`
5. `ruby run.rb`
